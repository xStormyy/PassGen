# PassGen
A Secure Login Credential Generator Using The Secret Module In Python.

## Roadmap

- [x] Settings (Password Length, Text File Name, etc.)
<!-- Email Generator (Using Tempmail's API) -->
<!-- Random Username Generator -->
- [ ] "Difficulty" Module which makes you be able to choose what the password should look like

## Usage (READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!)
I'd recommend putting the .py file into a seperate folder.
