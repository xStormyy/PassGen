# PassGen
A Secure Login Credential Generator Using The Secret Module In Python.

## Roadmap

- [x] Settings (Password Length, Text File Name, etc.)
- [ ] Email Generator (Using Tempmail's API)
- [ ] Random Username Generator 

## Usage (READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!)
I'd recommend putting the .py file into a seperate folder.

When you open the script for the first time, it will create a text file named "passwords", this stores all the already generated passwords in a list.
